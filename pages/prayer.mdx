Mozambique: Attack On Christian Village
On 30 December 2022, apparent jihadists killed at least two people and injured four others in a rural village in northern Mozambique. Images of burning houses in the village of Namande were posted on the Islamic State (IS) of Mozambique’s social media channels claiming responsibility for the attacks.

> "We were cooking our dinners when we started hearing shots. When I realized it was the terrorists, I took my family and we fled," a resident of the village told the Portuguese Lusa news agency.

Government forces launched several operations to stop the jihadists, but the clashes, which continued into the night, forced people to flee the village.

The province has been facing an armed insurgency since 2017 with many attacks claimed by IS. Since it began, the conflict has already displaced 1 million people, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and around 4,000 deaths, according to the ACLED conflict registration project.

Open Doors is stepping up its activities in Mozambique, working with local partners. In 2022 we distributed emergency food to Christians who did not receive enough food aid through official channels. Please continue to pray with Mozambique and its people.

Pray For Mozambique:

- Pray that Christians displaced because of violence will find safety and the trauma care they need.
- Pray that our local partners will serve persecuted Christians with wisdom and courage.
- Pray that Christians will be bold and share their faith with Muslims, and that many will come to know Jesus.

### MENTAC

Dear Faithful brothers and sisters,
I am so thankful for the churches that continue to pray and encourage me in this work.
We are in the final week of Ramadan, a month of fasting and feasting in hope of forgiveness and
reward. Thank you for your prayers as I, with many others, seek to proclaim peace with God through
Jesus Christ.
Give thanks for…

- many people who have visited the Peace Tent in the main street of Lakemba, have heard
  stories of Jesus, and have wanted to know more
- for the time I have spent with Ayesha who “feels calm and peace despite everything”
  when I tell her a story of Jesus.
  Please ask that …
- God’s Spirit would work through his Word in those who have visited the peace tent and
  that many would find Jesus.
- that Mary (who I talked with in the Peace tent) will maintain her wonder and interest in
  Jesus and we would be able to meet together soon.
- that Ayesha would know the peace Jesus gives and not just about it.
- that after Ramadan, there will be many women seeking to explore the Jesus of the Bible.
  In Him
  Margaret
