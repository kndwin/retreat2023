### Scripture

> "And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders
> fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden
> bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people." - Revelation 5:8 (NIV)

### Reflection

Praying parents can intercede for their children and grandchildren until, long after the death of the parents, those prayers still convey wonderful blessings. The godly intercessions of church and mission founders and leaders are answered over the decades. Every true intercessor prays many prayers which will not have their full answer before the prayer warrior joins the church in heaven. Prayers prayed in the Spirit never die until they accomplish God’s intended purpose. His answer may not be what we expected, or when we expected it, but God often provides much more abundantly than we could think or ask.

He interprets our intent and either answers or stores up our prayers (Revelation 8:2-5). Sincere prayers are never lost. Energy, time, love, and longing can be endowments that will never be wasted or go unrewarded. Jesus Christ continues to endow the church with His intercession. Paul endowed the church with prayer. The mighty outpourings of God’s Spirit in the Millennium and in the new heaven and the new earth will surely be built upon all those holy intercessions which were not fully answered before. You can endow with God’s mercies, with the Holy Spirit’s ministries, and with the angelic assistance and protections. Pray on and on; prayer is never, never in vain.
