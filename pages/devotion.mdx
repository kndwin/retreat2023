### Scripture

> "And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders
> fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden
> bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people." - Revelation 5:8 (NIV)

### Reflection

Praying parents can intercede for their children and grandchildren until, long after the death of the parents, those prayers still convey wonderful blessings. The godly intercessions of church and mission founders and leaders are answered over the decades. Every true intercessor prays many prayers which will not have their full answer before the prayer warrior joins the church in heaven. Prayers prayed in the Spirit never die until they accomplish God’s intended purpose. His answer may not be what we expected, or when we expected it, but God often provides much more abundantly than we could think or ask.

He interprets our intent and either answers or stores up our prayers (Revelation 8:2-5). Sincere prayers are never lost. Energy, time, love, and longing can be endowments that will never be wasted or go unrewarded. Jesus Christ continues to endow the church with His intercession. Paul endowed the church with prayer. The mighty outpourings of God’s Spirit in the Millennium and in the new heaven and the new earth will surely be built upon all those holy intercessions which were not fully answered before. You can endow with God’s mercies, with the Holy Spirit’s ministries, and with the angelic assistance and protections. Pray on and on; prayer is never, never in vain.

### Scripture

> "And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.
> Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. - Romans 5:16-18 (ESV)

### Reflection

God’s heart is set on the salvation of all men. This concerns God. He has declared this in the death of His Son by an unspeakable voice, and every movement on earth for this end pleases God. And so, He declares that our prayers for the salvation of all men are well pleasing in His sight. The sublime and holy inspiration of pleasing God should ever move us to prayer for all men. It is the embodiment and test of our devotion to God’s will and of our sympathetic loyalty to God.

Jesus Christ, a man, the God-man, the highest illustration of manhood, is the Mediator between God and man. Jesus Christ, this Divine man, died for all men. His life is but an intercession for all men. His death is but a prayer for all men. On earth, Jesus Christ knew no higher law, no holier business, no diviner life, than to plead for men. In Heaven He knows no more royal estate, no higher theme, than to intercede for men. His life, His death and His exaltation in Heaven all plead for men.

Is there any work, higher work for the disciple to do than His Lord did? Is there any loftier employment, more honorable, more divine, than to pray for men? To take their woes, their sins, and their perils before God; to be one with Christ? To break the thrall which binds them, the hell which holds them and lift them to immorality and eternal life?

### Psalms 113 (NIV)

<p>Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, you his servants;</p>
<p>praise the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Let the name of the Lord be praised,</p>
<p>both now and forevermore.</p>
<p>From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets,</p>
<p>the name of the Lord is to be praised.</p>

The Lord is exalted over all the nations,

<p>his glory above the heavens.</p>
<p>Who is like the Lord our God,</p>
<p>the One who sits enthroned on high,</p>
<p>who stoops down to look</p>
<p>on the heavens and the earth?</p>

He raises the poor from the dust

<p>and lifts the needy from the ash heap;</p>
<p>he seats them with princes,</p>
<p>with the princes of his people.</p>
<p>He settles the childless woman in her home</p>
<p>as a happy mother of children.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord.</p>
